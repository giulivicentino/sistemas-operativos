Well
I met Sally at a late night dive bar
She don't dance, but she downs her drinks
Heard through a friend, she's a born again wild card
She was telling me wild things
Well, she was telling me wild things
Lives down the street past the 7-Eleven
Just close enough that I spent the night
She grabbed my hand at the intersection
I spilled my guts at the red light
Sally
That feeling's coming around
Please don't go falling in love
Then disappear when the wine runs out (hey)
Sally
I'll buy a couple of rounds
Don't let me think I'm enough
Then disappear when the wine runs out
Well
I open up while she's flipping through pages
Getting lonely as the days get dark
If you're bored, and your mind starts changing
Maybe just give me a head start
And I, I see the glass in your eyes
Just trying to keep it alive
For crying out loud (oh)
Sally
That feeling's coming around
Please don't go falling in love
Then disappear when the wine runs out
Sally
I'll buy a couple of rounds
Don't let me think I'm enough
Then disappear when the wine runs out
Aw, shit, here we go again
I'm falling headfirst (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ankles hit the two-step
Sally makes my head hurt (hey)
Heard through the grapevine
She can be a diva
Cold like Minnesota
Hotter than a fever (hey)
Aw, shit, here we go again
I'm falling headfirst
Ankles hit the two-step
Sally makes my head hurt (hey)
Heard through the grapevine
She can be a diva
Cold like Minnesota
Hotter than a fever (hey)
Sally (hey)
That feeling's coming around (ah, ah)
Please don't go falling in love (oh)
Then disappear when the wine runs out (hey)
Sally
I'll buy a couple of rounds (I'll buy a couple)
Don't let me think I'm enough
Then disappear when the wine runs out
